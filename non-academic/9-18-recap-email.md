Dearest Team,

In many ways, the real work of this year starts tomorrow. Between our first week of real practice, the TOC, and academic work beginning to pile up, it's easy to being to become overwhelmed. But please remember, there are 70+ people going through the *exact same thing*, so help us help you. After all, this is a team sport, we do well when you do well.

As we move forward, I would like to share one piece of advice about swim practice that has always helped me compose myself in times like these. No matter how hard you try, the only thing you can do at swim practice is swim. You can't go to any meetings; You can't write any code; You can't finish any problem sets; All you can do is swim. Take an extended break from whatever stresses you may have festering and **just swim**.

But to be honest, despite the storm of stress that may or may not be lurking just over the horizon, I just feel *good* about this team. I see you guys getting better every day. Between seeing you guys start to enjoy your classes, and seeming some awesome swimming at practice, I have no doubt that we have set ourselves up phenomenally to ***kick ass*** this year.


Time to put our hearts in the work,

Your Seniors
