Dearest Team,

For those who are unaware, the [TOC](http://engineering.cmu.edu/companies/toc/) is ***next week***. In preparation, the seniors will be hosting a resume / cover letter / elevator pitch workshop this Saturday in Wean 5302 from 1pm to 3pm. Feel free to bring any and all questions regarding the TOC, from the aforementioned topics, to looking through [Handshake](https://cmu.joinhandshake.com/login) for companies that you would like to apply to. We will try have representatives from all schools to try and reach a broad audience.

Regarding the TOC itself, please make an effort and try and go. Even you're a bright-eyed freshman ~~absoloutely zero~~ minimal work experience, it's important for you to *just go*. Getting comfortable with the chaotic and sometimes overwhelming setting of literally thousands of people clamoring for jobs is half the battle of the TOC, so it's important to go now when the stakes are low. Who knows? You might even land an interview!

Just to get started I have attached the *totally real* resume of mine. Feel free to look it over as a formatting template, or just scrap it completely.

It's a Great Day to be an Employed Tartan,

Sivan Mehta
