Dearest Freshman,

As you all are enjoying this wonderful summer, the Seniors would just like to reach out and welcome to you to CMU Varsity Swimming and Diving! If you weren't already aware, the class of 2020 is an *enormous* class; with 11 women and 16 men joining the team, you guys are going to make a sizable impact on every facet of the team right out of the gate. Being said, the 23 returning women and 19 returning men simply can not wait to meet all of you. 

We all know what a big transition this is, and making the shift to college, especially one as demanding as CMU, can seem like a daunting task. But remember, you're coming to school with 69 people who *want to help you succeed*. After all, this is a team sport, we do well when you do well. If you haven't already, please join the [CMU Varsity Swimming & Diving](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cmuswim/) Facebook group. That, along with the intermittent email, will be the primary means of communication on the team. Be sure to set your current school on Facebook to Carnegie Mellon, as the group is closed within the CMU community. If there are any questions that you have moving forward, you're more than welcome to post there or reach out to any of the upperclassmen on the team.

As we head towards Orientation week, here are a few things to keep in mind. Since this is a swimming and diving team, do your best to stay in the water this summer. Hitting the ground running with training is one of the best things you can do to set up your season well, and makes settling to a rhythm once you're at school *much* easier. Also remember to get all of the associated paperwork with the team [here](http://athletics.cmu.edu/athletics/sportsmed/forms) processed as soon as possible. This is a real pain in the buns to do once you start school, so try and get it done ahead of time.

However, the most important thing to remember as you prepare for your assuredly awesome career here at CMU is **do not stress**. If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out to your seniors as ***literally all of us have done this before***. We would be more than happy to help you out.

Your Seniors

P.S. I have attached the schedule for the season and the team's contact information if you haven't already received them from Coach.
