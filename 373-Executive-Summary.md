## Background
SwiftCeipt was started in 2013 in the Oakland district of Pittsburgh as a tech solution to managing receipts and finances. People have to deal with receipts coming from various vendors all the time. These receipts usually appear in different format, e.g. paper or email. In most cases, these receipts are unruly and unmanageable due to them not being sorted in any logical order. With SwiftCeipt, a user no longer has to face these issues, as their receipts are easily itemized, stored, and made accessible via an iOS app. These features are summarized simply in the company’s mantra: Manage receipts effortlessly forever.

## Project Description

### Opportunity 

Initially, SwiftCeipt’s only product was an iOS application, which limited the expansion of their user base. We also found that the available features of the SwiftCeipt are limited, which makes it hard to distinguish from other available products in the market. With these in mind, our team found that we could add most value to the organization through a web application that non-iOS users can access. It also expands the feature set to those that aren’t appropriate on a mobile application.

### Vision

Knowing this situation, our team believed we could add the most value to them by creating a desktop application. This would surely allow them to expand their user base beyond only iOS users to anyone with a web browser. On top of the existing feature set, we aimed to explore and create more interesting and innovative features based on the needs and visions of our client. For example, the folder feature to organize the receipts, data visualization feature.

## Development

### Outcomes

Our outcomes largely manifest themselves in the extra features we developed for their desktop application. The desktop application allows them to increase their user base past iOS users in all users with a web browser, making the product more accessible to small business owners, their target audience. The folder feature allows users to easily organize receipts into logical groups, and when considered with the newly implemented graphs and maps, take advantage of the inherent advantages of a desktop application.

### Deliverables

In our final deliverables, we will include source code, documentation for setup, testing instructions, and recommendations for the future of the product. All of these have been documented and generated over the course of development in a [GitHub repository owned by SwiftCeipt](https://github.com/swiftceipt/SC-XW1).

### Recommendations

We recommend our client to enhance testing for their backend database, especially for the newly created functionalities--the folder feature. A well-tested backend will make the web application more solid and reliable. We also recommend our client to implement a user tutorial after they are done with the Google login feature. This will be user-friendlier for first time users. Lastly, we highly recommend our client to conduct a full user test to get feedback from different user groups.
